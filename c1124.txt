English oak was originally planted because it could be used in so many ways. Not only is the wood very hardy, the bark was used for tanning and branches for firewood. Later on, it was planted to convert pine forests into deciduous woods. English oak grows well in many soils, as long as it has sufficient light. This species of oak can reach a very ripe old age. The oldest know English Oak in Europe grows in Lithuania and is 1500 years old!
