The last pair of the Blue Crab's legs are paddle-shaped for swimming. The shell is more than twice as wide as long with 9 marginal teeth (the 9th is a strong spine). The shell is usually olive or bluish-green above and the claws are bright blue below (young are paler). The male's abdomen is abruptly tapered, while the female's is more broadly rounded. Adults may reach a width of 225 mm between the tips of the longest spines. (Gosner 1978)
