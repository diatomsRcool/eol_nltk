The rest of the coat is short and tawny in colour for both sexes, paler on the underside, without markings. The backs of the ears and the tuft of hair at the tip of the tail are dark brown or black (5). Lion cubs are born with brown rosettes that disappear with maturity, although some lions retain faint spots (6). Asiatic lions (P.l. persica), the only subspecies found outside the African continent, are slightly smaller than their African cousins, and have shorter, thinner manes, clear of the ears, and a fold of skin running the length of their belly that is rare in African lions (7) (8).
