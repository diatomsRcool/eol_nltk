Walruses feed on animals that reside on the surface of the bottom of the ocean, or in the sediments that coat the bottom. Occasionally, walruses also prey on fish, seals, and young whales. Feeds primarily on bivalve mollusks; principally clams. Also consumes many other benthic invertebrates. Generally eats fleshy portion of bivalve; rejects the shell. Some individuals may feed on fishes, birds, or other marine mammals.
