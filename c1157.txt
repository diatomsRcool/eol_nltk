According to MÃ¼ller of 19th century Germany, the small amount of nectar in the flowers attracts various kinds of flies, including Soldier flies, Bee flies, Syrphid flies (which also feed on the pollen), Muscid flies, Crane flies, and Dung flies. It is possible that small bees also visit the flowers, but they are probably less common.
