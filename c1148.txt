Castro (1993) published descriptive diet data for the finetooth shark in the northwest Atlantic off the coasts of South Carolina and Daytona Beach, FL, and found teleosts (Atlantic Menhaden (Brevoortia tyrannus), Spot Croaker (Leiostomus xanthurus), Spanish Mackerel (Scomberomorus maculatus), and Mugil species) to be the primary prey. In northwest Florida, Finetooth Sharks fed almost entirely on menhaden and showed no ontogenetic shift in diet (Bethea et al. 2004).
