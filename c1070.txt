It is the largest known living macropredatory fish and is one of the primary predators of marine mammals. It also eats a variety of other marine animals including fish, seals, and seabirds. As the antihero of Jaws, the great white shark is depicted as a ferocious man eater, they are not indiscriminate eating machines but ambush hunters, taking prey by surprise from below. It is an epipelagic fish, observed mostly in the presence of rich game like fur seals, sea lions, small whales, other sharks, sea turtles, and large bony fish species. Although the great white is typically regarded as an apex predator in the wild, it is in rare cases preyed upon by the larger orca (also known as a killer whale).
