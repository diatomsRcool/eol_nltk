They grow very quickly, but after reaching 100-200 years of age their rate of growth slows down. After this time, however they continue to increase in girth (5). This oak is a very long-lived species; specimens typically live for up to 500 years, but some oaks are known to be 700 to 1200 years old (5). Indeed, Britain has more ancient oaks than any other country in western Europe (4).
