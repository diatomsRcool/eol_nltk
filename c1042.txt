Important invertebrate enemies of adult bees include Thomisidae and Araneidae, wasps in the genus Philanthus (called “beewolves”), and many species of social wasps in the family Vespidae. Vespid wasp colonies are known to attack honeybee colonies en masse, and can wipe out a hive in one attack. Many vertebrate insectivores also eat adult honeybees. Toads (Bufo) that can reach the entrance of hive will sit and eat many workers, as will opossums (Didelphis). Birds are an important threat – the Meropidae (bee-eaters) in particular in Africa and southern Europe, but also flycatchers around the world (Tyrranidae and Muscicapidae). Apis_mellifera in Africa are also subject to attack by Indicatoridae. These birds eat hive comb, consuming bees, wax, and stored honey. At least one species, the greater honeyguide (Indicator_indicator) will guide mammal hive predators to hives, and then feed on the hive after the mammal has opened it up. The main vertebrate predators of hives are mammals. Ursidae frequently attack the nests of social bees and wasps, as do many Mustelidae such as the Eira barbara in the Neotropics and especially the Mellivora capensis of Africa and southern and western Asia. In the Western Hemisphere Mephitidae, Cingulata and Vermilingua also raid hives, as do pangolins (Manis) in Africa. Large primates, including Papio, chimpanzees (<>) and Gorilla are reported to attack hives too. Smaller mammals such as mice (Mus) and rats (Rattus) will burrow into hives as well. Some insects are predators in hives as well, including wax moth larvae (Galleria_mellonella, Achroia_grisella), and hive beetles (Hylostoma, Aethina), and some species of Formicidae. In their native regions these tend not to be important enemies, but where honeybees have not co-evolved with these insects and have no defense, they can do great harm to hives. Known Predators:
