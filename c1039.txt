Bacteria infect bees, notably Bacillus_larvae, agent of American Foulbrood disease, and Melissococcus_pluton, agent of European Foulbrood. Fungi grow in bee hives, and Ascosphaera_apis can cause Chalkbrood disease. One of the most common diseases in domesticated hives is Nosema disease, caused by a protozoan, Nosema_apis. An amoeba, Malphigamoeba_mellificae, also causes disease in honeybees.
