This oak, the 'king of trees' has a special place in the English psyche, and is a well-loved symbol of strength and duration (4). It is a magnificent tree, with a broad, irregular crown. The bark is grey and fissured, and develops burrs as it ages (5). The massive main branches often develop low on the trunk and become twisted and gnarled with age (2). The leaves have 5-7 pairs of lobes, forming a typical 'wavy-edged' outline; the upper surface is dark green, the underside is paler, and young leaves are often covered in a layer of fine downy hairs (2). The fruits, known as acorns, occur in clusters on long stalks known as peduncles (hence the common name of this species); the egg-shaped acorns sit in scaly cups that measure up to 18mm across (6).
