Pseudo-nitzschia is a pennate diatom that can be between 75-144Âµm long according to Hasle (1965). In valve view the middle part of the cell has more roughly parallel margins while the valve ends are slightly rostrate. The fibulae are more distinct than the interstriae. There are 12-18 interstriae and fibulae per 10 Âµm and 2 rows of poroids per stria. There are 4-6 poroids per 1Âµm.
