The common earthworm is an abundant species, which has an important role in the aeration and fertilisation of soil (3). It is the largest British earthworm (5) and has a reddish-brown back, a yellowish underside and an often prominent orange-red 'saddle' region known as the 'clitellum', close to the reproductive organs. Although this earthworm has a cylindrical body, the tail region may become flattened (2). The body is segmented, and has visible rings known as annuli; each segment bears small hairs known as 'chaetae', which help the worm to move through the soil (3).
