Characterised as fearsome, courageous and majestic, the lion's strength and ferocity has earned it accolades such as 'King of Beasts' in many cultures (2). As the largest African carnivore and rivalling the tiger (Panthera tigris) as the largest of the 'big cats', the lion is built to prey on animals many times its size, its strong jaws and muscular build emanating an image of sheer power. Males are larger than females and typically posses a mane of hair around their heads, a feature unique amongst the cat family (Felidae) (4).
