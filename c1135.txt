Blue crabs are immigrants from the east coast of North America, where they are common and extensively fished. They are sporadically found in the Netherlands. It is unknown whether the animals are able to reproduce here or that the larvae come from elsewhere. If you should see one, you can't be mistaken. The blue crab is large, has beautiful colors, blue legs and two tips on the sides of its carapace.
