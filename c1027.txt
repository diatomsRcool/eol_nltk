Walruses are primarily bottom feeders and shallow divers (Fay 1982, Born 2005). Most prey taken is found in the upper few centimeters of sediment, or lives on or just above the bottom. A wide variety of benthic invertebrates, with several species of clams, make up the majority of food for most animals. Their diet also includes other species of molluscs, and many species of worms, snails, soft shell crabs, amphipods, shrimp, sea cucumbers, tunicates, and slow-moving fish. Some individuals prey on seals, small whales and seabirds and may occasionally scavenge marine mammal carcasses.
