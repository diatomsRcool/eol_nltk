Lions are predatory carnivores, with females performing most of the hunting, usually at night to avoid detection. They feed upon almost any animal, from rodent to rhino, but medium- to large-sized ungulates, such as antelope, zebra and wildebeest, form the bulk of their prey. They will also scavenge, chasing other predators away from their kills.
